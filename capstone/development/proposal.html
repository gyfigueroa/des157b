        <h1>Captone Project Proposal</h1>
        <p>The topic I am thinking about examining is how AI impacts our humanity. There is a variety of perspectives you could take on this subject but I am particularly interested in exploring how a growing dependency on AI may lead to the death of intellectualism or purported common sense. Since ChatGPT has grown in popularity in recent years I’ve noticed that on the internet there seems to be two very distinct sides: those that actively use it for day to day activities and those who seem to be morally against it. As a college student I’ve noticed that a majority of my peers have adopted it seemingly overnight to help with anything from homework assignments or as a personal therapist. It makes me wonder if this dependence on AI for tasks that normally require significant levels of human cognition will lead to a sort of learning decline. </p>
        <p>This topic will rely on speculative design by taking a look at past historic milestones in technology and examining any pattens that might be mirrored with the rise of AI and imagine utopian/dystopian implications of becoming so reliant on AI for mundane mental tasks. Depending on the amount of research/data I can find related to this subject, I would like to include some simple data visualizations to back up some of these concepts or patterns.</p>
        <p>I’m imagining a scrolling webpage similar to an interactive slideshow that incorporates clean and smooth animations to reinforce the narrative of the story. One of my ideas is to have two parallel storylines that showcase someone who blindly relies on AI and someone who continues exercising their brain with mundane tasks, though I’m not sure how much time I will have to write/implement such a complex narrative structure.</p>
        <p>Another idea I’m interested in exploring is ways that AI could be used as an invaluable tool or assistant in the future. I think my core idea takes a very pessimistic  view of AI but I’m not opposed to changing the framing of the narrative from negative to positive as it progresses depending on what I find out after doing more research. This would resemble more closely a challenging the mental models approach.</p>
