        <h1>Capstone Project Usability Testing Results</h1>

        <p>One of the main things I observed was that the narrative was clear for most users but people had a hard time remembering Hannah Fry's definition of intelligence by just reading the description at the start. One user mentioned that the "Think back to..." verbiage towards the end of the webpage where it was calling back to the definition at the start was helpful at refreshing their memory.</p>
        <p>Another observation that I made across almost all users was that upon scrolling past the landing page they would immediately click the red link taking them to the original YouTube video that inspired this project. This would often cause the user to disengage with this portion of the website and thus miss essential context for the rest of the narrative. I think this is in part due to the fact that I styled it as a bright red highlight on a dark gray page so it immediately stuck out. In future iterations I might just create a references page at the end to avoid any possible distractions at the start of the experience or change the styling to be more subtle.</p>
        <p>One of the last observations I made was that most people were a bit confused by the inclusion of gorillas in the narrative. Some users commented that they were distracted when they were scrolling and might've skipped some important information. One user suggested adding more emphasis on the words "Gorilla problem" might help solve this issue since currently the only mention of it in the smaller paragraph text, which I think would be valuable to implement in a future iteration.</p>
        <p>Another user commented on how the continuity of the narrative felt interrupted by the timeline of gorillas to AI towards the beginning of the page. But also noted that the narrative was very easy to follow after that section. In a another implemetation I'd like to try to ease users into that section a little more since I think the rapid switch was causing some confusion.</p>
