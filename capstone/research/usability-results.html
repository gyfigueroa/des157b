        <h1>Capstone Project Usability Report</h1>

        <h2>List of Features</h2>
        <p><strong> 1.   Tweet/social media component.</strong> A basic reusable template for this can be coded in vanilla HTML and CSS and will be reused by a short javascript program that reads tweets compiled in a JSON file and automatically fills out the template and adds elements back into the DOM. I think I am capable of coming up with this on my own.</p>
        <p><strong>2.   Animated AI orb.</strong> A simple animated graphic I will create which will be used as a narrative element in my page (orbs will grow or shrink periodically throughout to represent an evolution in intelligence). This will consist of a series of circles superimposed on each other and a short javascript that randomly sets the color, filter, and size of each circle to create a fluid, "live" animation. I also think I am capable of developing this on my own.</p>
        <p><strong>3.   Animated elements and graphics throughout the page.</strong> To break up some of the text in my narrative storylines I will include graphics that animate as you scroll on screen. To implement this I will be using a the javascript library Animate on Scroll to handle objects entering and exiting the viewport. For more specific animations where animations might not always follow the linear scrolling down the page I will use anchors to trigger certain animations which is a built in feature of the library.</p>
