        <h1>Capstone Case Study: Chat, are we cooked? Exploring the Gorilla Problem</h1>

        <h2>Overview</h2>
        <p>"Chat, Are We Cooked?" is an interactive, narrative-based webpage designed to explore the cultural and intellectual implications of humanity's growing reliance on artificial intelligence. This project is intended for digital natives, particularly college students who are both active users and critical observers of emerging technologies. The goal was to encourage thoughtful reflection on how AI is reshaping cognitive habits, creativity, and social dynamics. The project uses speculative design to consider utopian and dystopian outcomes, drawing parallels to historical technological revolutions. The final format is a scroll-based storytelling experience enhanced with animations and visual commentary. Early brainstorming included thematic mind maps and narrative concepts centered around human evolution, cognition, and digital tools.</p>

        <h2>UX Research</h2>
        <p>The research phase began with comparative analysis of two key projects: "Infant Sleep Training" by The Pudding and "Understanding Neurodiversity" by Project Lima. The Pudding's use of social media posts to deepen narrative context inspired the integration of tweet-based commentary in my own project, reinforcing the idea that cultural discourse can be both data and design. Project Lima’s restrained use of data paired with thoughtful microanimations showed that an immersive experience doesn’t need to rely heavily on statistics. This shifted my design direction toward minimal yet meaningful data visualization, and strengthened my decision to focus on visual storytelling supported by speculative insights rather than raw analytics.</p>

        <h2>Visual Design</h2>
        <p>The visual development of the project emphasized storytelling through clean design and intentional contrast. A dark background paired with pops of red drew focus to key elements, although usability testing later prompted adjustments. I incorporated an animated AI orb as a symbolic and dynamic motif to illustrate growth and uncertainty. Scroll-triggered animations were implemented using AOS.js, and for more customized motion, anchor-based triggers were created. The design evolved through rounds of iteration, including changes to layout, typography, and pacing based on peer feedback. These visual decisions were aimed at reinforcing the speculative tone of the project while maintaining accessibility and clarity.</p>

        <h2>User Interface</h2>
        <p>The interface is built around a linear scroll model that introduces concepts sequentially, mimicking the timeline of human and AI evolution. Specific UI components include a fixed-width tweet layout rendered dynamically via a JSON file, a simplified navigation flow, and animations that guide attention to each narrative beat. Usability principles were considered at every step: visibility of system status through animation cues, minimalism to reduce cognitive load, and consistency in visual language. Users can explore the progression from gorillas to humans to AI, review social commentary, and reflect on design metaphors like the AI orb and evolutionary timelines. Tasks are intuitive: scroll, read, reflect.</p>

        <h2>Revisions</h2>
        <p>User testing revealed several opportunities for improvement. Many users clicked away early due to the prominence of a red link to the original video source, which unintentionally distracted from the narrative. In response, I plan to relocate this reference to the end of the experience or restyle it for subtlety. Some users were confused by the "gorilla problem" reference; I intend to emphasize this term visually and better contextualize its relevance earlier in the story. Another issue was retention: Hannah Fry’s definition of intelligence introduced at the beginning was often forgotten by users. A call-back near the end helped, and future versions may include a more visual reinforcement of key definitions throughout.</p>

        <h2>Summary</h2>
        <p>This project taught me how to think critically about narrative structure, visual coherence, and the role of speculative design in UX. I am most proud of the balance I struck between humor, research, and design to make a complex topic accessible and engaging. The most challenging aspect was refining the flow of information without overwhelming or confusing the user. The most rewarding part was seeing users interact with the piece as both a narrative and a prompt to consider their own relationships with technology. Ultimately, this capstone project was an incredibly fullfilling experiment in storytelling through design.</p>
